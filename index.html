  <h3>Stories </h3>

  <h4> <u>Olivia </u></h4>
  <p> "Since I stopped trying to hide, I feel like my body belongs to me. I don’t feel ashamed anymore. I don’t feel broken, and I don’t even spend much time thinking about the fact I have scars." <br> <br></p>

  <h4> <u>Josh </u></h4>
  <p> "People care, they love you, and they want to support you. There's somebody and something in this world that is better because you're around. I know it might be hard to see, but it's there. Explore and look for that. You're important and you matter. If you could stick around for that, you'd be helping tremendously. Just because you've been in one place at one point doesn't mean you can't make an incredible life for yourself and help other people. Everybody's important and everybody matters. Just because you don't see it right now doesn't mean it's not true." <br><br> </p>

  <h4> <u>Jordan </u></h4>
  <p> "The main message is that you are not the only one going through these problems or ideas...you can verbalize them and you can cope with them in a healthy way to get you through that."
 <br> <br></p>

  <h4> <u>Mike </u></h4>
  <p> "I want to share this with you because life is complicated, hard and often, a constant struggle. But that doesn’t mean you have to do it alone." </p>
